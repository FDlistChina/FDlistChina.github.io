In this talk, we focus on the applications of Hall algebras in quantum groups and 
quantum cluster algebras. Explicitly, we provide Hall algebras for $m$-periodic derived 
categories of hereditary abelian categories, give realizations of quantum cluster 
characters via Hall algebras and define cluster characters for $2$-Calabi-Yau Frobenius 
extriangulated categories with cluster tilting objects.

  I will present joint work with Quoc P. Ho on our theory of graded sheaves, which offers a uniform construction 
  of "mixed versions" or "graded lifts" in the sense of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel applicable to arbitrary Artin 
  stacks. As a straightforward reinterpretation of classical results, this framework allows for the categorification 
  of many quantum algebras, including Hecke algebras and positive quantum groups, through graded sheaves. 
  In a new application, we introduce a graded version of Lusztig's character sheaves and utilize it to prove 
  a conjecture by Gorsky, Negut, and Rasmussen, which establishes a connection between the HOMFLY homology of knots 
  and links and the cohomology of coherent sheaves on Hilbert schemes.

<p class="main1"> 
  Semi-orthogonal decomposition serves as a powerful tool for understanding derived categories. 
  Through the additivity theorem, it also aids in computing (higher) algebraic K-theory. Additionally, 
  Hermitian K-theory—a quadratic refinement of algebraic K-theory—can be approached using semi-orthogonal 
  decomposition, with the main focus on understanding the symmetry of semi-orthogonal decompositions under 
  various dualities in derived categories. In this talk, I will explain how semi-orthogonal decomposition 
  can be utilized to understand the connecting homomorphism in the localization sequence of Hermitian K-theory 
  and present several computations employing this approach.

<strong>Tilting-completion for gentle algebras</strong>

<p class="main1"> 
  It is proved that any almost tilting module over a gentle algebra is partial tilting, that is, it can be completed as a tilting module. Furthermore, 
  it has at most $2n$ complements, which confirms a （deformed）conjecture of Happel for the case of gentle algebras. At the same time, for any $n > 2$ 
  and $0< m < n-1$, there always exists a connected gentle algebra with rank n and a pre-tilting module over it with rank m which is not partial tilting. 
  The tool we use is the surface model associated with the module category of a gentle algebra. The main technique is doing inductions by cutting the surface, 
  which is expected to be useful elsewhere.

<p class="main1"> 
  The aim of my talk (based on joint work in progress with Arkady Berenstein and Vladimir Retakh) is to introduce and study certain noncommutative algebras A for any marked orbifold. 
  These algebras admit noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group G which is either free or one-relator (we call it triangle group) into the multiplicative monoid A×. 
  The clusters are parametrized by triangulations of the orbifold and exhibit a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon, which asserts that generators of the algebra can be written as sums 
  of the images of elements of G for any noncommutative cluster. If the surface is unpunctured, then our algebra A can be specialized to the ordinary quantum cluster algebra, and the 
  noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon becomes the (positive) quantum one.
It turns out that there is a natural action of a certain braid-like group Br_A by automorphisms of G on each cluster in a compatible way (this is, indeed, the braid group Br_n if the 
surface is an unpunctured disk with n+2 marked boundary points). If surface is punctured, the algebra A admits a family of commuting automorphisms which will give new clusters and new "tagged" noncommutative Laurent Phenomena.
  There are important elements in A assigned to each marked point, which we refer to as noncommutative angles (or h-lengths). 
  They belong to the group algebra of each cluster group and are invariant under all noncommutative cluster mutations. This eventually gives rise to noncommutative integrable systems on unpunctured 
  cylinders and other surfaces which, in particular, recover the ones introduced by Kontsevich in 2011 together with their Laurentness and positivity.

  In this talk, I present our recent results on affine vertex operator superalgebra $L_{\widehat{osp(1|2)}}(l,0)$ at admissible level $l$.  
  We prove that the category of weak $L_{\widehat{osp(1|2)}}(l,0)$-modules on which the positive part of $\widehat{osp(1|2)}$ acts locally nilpotently is semisimple. 
  Then we prove that Q-graded vertex operator superalgebras $(L_{\widehat{osp(1|2)}}(l,0),\omega_\xi)$ with a new Virasoro element $\omega_\xi$ are rational and the irreducible modules 
  are exactly the admissible modules for $\widehat{osp(1|2)}$, where $0<\xi<1$ 
  is a rational number. Furthermore, we determine the Zhu's algebras $A(L_{\widehat{osp(1|2)}}(l,0))$ and their bimodules $A(L(l,j))$ 
  for $(L_{\widehat{osp(1|2)}}(l,0),\omega_\xi)$, where $j$ is the admissible weight. As an application, we calculate the fusion rules among the irreducible ordinary modules 
  of $(L_{\widehat{osp(1|2)}}(l,0),\omega_\xi)$. This is a joint work with Huaimin Li.

<strong>Cohomology, deformations, and homotopy of post-Lie algebras</strong>

<p class="main1"> 
  Guided by Koszul duality theory, we consider the graded Lie algebra of coderivations of the cofree conilpotent graded cocommutative cotrialgebra generated by a graded vector space V. 
  We show that in the case of V being a shift of an ungraded vector space W, Maurer-Cartan elements of this graded Lie algebra are exactly post-Lie algebra structures on W. 
  The cohomology of a post-Lie algebra is then defined using Maurer-Cartan twisting. The second cohomology group of a post-Lie algebra has a familiar interpretation as 
  equivalence classes of infinitesimal deformations. Next we define a post-Lie-infty algebra structure on a graded vector space to be a Maurer-Cartan element of the aforementioned graded Lie algebra. 
  Post-Lie-infty algebras admit a useful characterization in terms of L-infty-actions (or open-closed homotopy Lie algebras). Finally, we introduce the notion of homotopy Rota-Baxter operators on open-closed homotopy 
  Lie algebras and show that certain homotopy Rota-Baxter operators induce post-Lie-infty algebras. This is a joint work with Andrey Lazarev and Rong Tang.

  In 2018, in their study of deformations of spaces of stability conditions, Ikeda-Qiu introduced $\mathbb{X}$-Calabi-Yau completions (=bigraded CY-completions)

  category of representations. We will report on joint work with Fan Li and Yu Qiu where we generalize this theorem to suitable differential graded algebras. 
  We will then compare this result with Hanihara's recent generalization to dg algebras of Happel's description of the derived category as the singularity category of the repetitive algebra.

A cluster algebra is a $\mathbb{Z}$-subalgebra of a rational function field generated by a special set of 
generators called cluster variables, which are grouped into overlapping subsets of fixed size, 
called clusters. One can travel from one cluster to the others by a recursive process called mutation. 
Cluster monomials are monomials in cluster variables from a single cluster. 
A fundamental problem in cluster algebras is to characterize when two cluster variables are contained 
in the same cluster. A more general problem is to characterize when the product of two cluster monomials 
is still a cluster monomial. In this talk, we introduce F-invariant in cluster algebras and use it to 
characterize when the product of two cluster monomials is still a cluster monomial.

  We describe the upper seminormal crystal structure for the $\mu$-supported $\delta$-vectors for any quiver with potential with reachable frozen vertices,

We show that the crystal structure can be algebraically lifted to the generic basis of the upper cluster algebra.
This can be viewed as an additive categorification of the crystal structure arising from cluster algebras.
We introduce the biperfect bases and the strong biperfect bases in the cluster algebra setting and give a description of all (strong) biperfect bases, which are parametrized by lattice points in a product of explicit polyhedral sets.

  In 1996, Xu proved the following result: if the class of pure injective modules is closed under extensions, then every cotorsion module is pure injective. 
  The proof is based on the fact that every module has a pure injective envelope. It is natural to conjecture that if the class of pure projective module is closed extensions, 
  then every FP-projective module is pure projective. We note that although every module has a pure projective precover, it may not have a pure projective cover, 
  hence the argument used by Xu can not be dualized to the above conjecture. In this talk, I will present how to solve this conjecture by developing a theory of infinite powers of approximating ideals. 
  A key tool in this theory is an ideal version of Eklof Lemma.  I will present the proof of this result. The talk is based on a joint work with Sergio Estrada,Ivo Herzog, and Sinem Odabasi.

  for smooth and finite dimensional graded gentle algebras. If two graded gentle algebras have the same invariants 
  then they are necessarily derived equivalent. It was conjectured that the converse also holds. 
  <br/>&emsp;&nbsp;
  In this talk, we confirm this conjecture, based on a full description on the (non)existence of a silting object in 
  the perfect derived category of a smooth and finite dimensional graded gentle algebra. This is a joint work with 
  Haibo Jin and Sibylle Schroll.

<p class="main1"> Abstract: Triangular bases are Kazhdan-Lusztig type bases for quantum cluster algebras. 
  Examples include the dual canonical bases for the quantized coordinate rings of unipotent subgroups. 
  In this talk, we show the existence of these bases for the quantized coordinate rings of the double Bruhat cells, 
  generalizing the results from unipotent subgroups. It is worth noting that when the Cartan matrix is symmetric, 
  their structure constants are positive and they have monoidal categorification after minor modification.

<p class="main1"> Abstract: Koszul duality between algebras has been generalized by Ginzburg-Kapranov in their famous
  work on Koszul duality between operads. For example, we have a nice duality between 
  Lie and Comm operads. In the 90’s, Getlzer obtained a beautiful generalization of this: a Koszul
  duality between Grav and Hyper-Comm operads. These operads are defined using moduli 
  spaces of genus zero curves and the corresponding Deligne-Mumford compactifications. 
  In this talk, we will discuss a higher genus version of this duality. The talk is based on a joint 
  work in progress with Lino Amorim.

<strong>Hall algebra approach to iquantum groups</strong>

<p class="main1"> Abstract: The iquantum group is a generalization of quantum groups, which arises from the construction of quantum symmetric pairs by Letzter. 
A striking breakthrough of the iquantum groups is the discovery of canonical basis by Bao-Wang. It has been found that most of the fundamental constructions of quantum groups admit generalizations in the setting of iquantum groups. 
<br/>&emsp;&nbsp;
In this talk, we will review several recent progress on Hall algebra realization of iquantum groups. 
We use derived Hall algebras of 1-periodic derived category to realize split iquantum groups. 
We introduce a new kind of algebra associated to a hereditary abelian category, and prove that it is isomorphic to the 1-periodic derived Hall algebra. 
We define a derived Hall algebra of the root category following Xiao-Xu. When applied to the Jordan quiver or elliptic curves, these algebras provide categorical realizations of the Drinfeld double of the ring of symmetric functions and also double affine Hecke algebras. 
This is a series work joint with Jiayi Chen, Yanan Lin, Ming Lu and Weiqiang Wang.
